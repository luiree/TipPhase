# TipPhase

Hi!

TipPhase is a collection of code and data that I created to study enzymatic processes that may occur at the tips of microtubules.

Some of the results are on the biorxiv and about to be published:
"Multivalent interactions facilitate motor-dependent protein accumulation at growing microtubule plus ends"

This repository also contains data that had been produced and python scripts for plotting. 
You also will find some bash scripts to automate cluster runs and some of the analysis. 

Random numbers for stochastic simulations are generated using the GNU Scientific Library 2.6 ( here for example: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/ ), so make sure to install it before you start, or modify for your preferred random number generator.

There is no guarantee this code will work in your environment. I used g++ 7.5.0 from the GCC on Ubuntu 18.04 and custom bash scripts to compile and generate different versions of the code.

Take care,
Louis
