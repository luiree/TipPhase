make_density.cpp is a program that averages profiles of 0/1s or 0/2s and produces a density profile that can be plotted.
Parameters are the system size and which number should be taken the average of. Make sure you read the code before you use it.

In the code collection it is either used as ./trj or ./a.out

Examples:
1) produces a motor density
./trj 3p0/trjLK_den0.024390.dat 1000 2 > trjLK_3p0.den

2) produces a cargo density
./trj 3p0/trjTIP_den0.024390.dat 1000 1 > trjTIP_3p0.den
