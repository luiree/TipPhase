The synthax for running a simulation looks for example like this:

./tt7_CAR0-OLI0-CAP0-CLUS0-DET0.out 20 67

The executable carries the name of the model that is being ran.
The first parameter is concentration in nM of motors and the second parameter is a seed for the random number generator (useful when you want to produce in parallel).

The models are characterised by keywords in the executable and directories, and as 0/1 for the filenames.

CAR - indicates if there is cargo or not (0/1)
OLI - indicates of there is oligomerization (0/1)
CAP - indicates if there is a GTP cap and its hydrolysis (0/1)
CLUS - indicates if there is clustering (0/1)
DET - indicates if there is detachment from clusters (0/1)

if applicable:
off? indicates an additional detachment rate
